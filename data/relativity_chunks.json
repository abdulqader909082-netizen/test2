["7. Special Relativity\nAlthough Newtonian mechanics gives an excellent description of Nature, it is not uni-\nversally valid. When we reach extreme conditions — the very small, the very heavy or\nthe very fast — the Newtonian Universe that we’re used to needs replacing. You could\nsay that Newtonian mechanics encapsulates our common sense view of the world. One\nof the major themes of twentieth century", "orld. One\nof the major themes of twentieth century physics is that when you look away from our\neveryday world, common sense is not much use.\nOne such extreme is when particles travel very fast. The theory that replaces New-\ntonian mechanics is due to Einstein. It is called special relativity. The e↵ects of special\nrelativity become apparent only when the speeds of particles become comparable to\nth", "en the speeds of particles become comparable to\nthe speed of light in the vacuum. The speed of light is\nc = 299792458 ms−1\nThis value of c is exact. It may seem strange that the speed of light is an integer\nwhen measured in meters per second. The reason is simply that this is taken to be\nthe deﬁnition of what we mean by a meter: it is the distance travelled by light in\n1/299792458 seconds. For the", "travelled by light in\n1/299792458 seconds. For the purposes of this course, we’ll be quite happy with the\napproximation c ⇡3 ⇥108 ms−1.\nThe ﬁrst thing to say is that the speed of light is fast. Really fast. The speed of\nsound is around 300 ms−1; escape velocity from the Earth is around 104 ms−1; the\norbital speed of our solar system in the Milky Way galaxy is around 105 ms−1. As we\nshall soon see,", "y galaxy is around 105 ms−1. As we\nshall soon see, nothing travels faster than c.\nThe theory of special relativity rests on two experimental facts. (We will look at the\nevidence for these shortly). In fact, we have already met the ﬁrst of these: it is simply\nthe Galilean principle of relativity described in Section 1. The second postulate is more\nsurprising:\n• Postulate 1: The principle of relativ", "urprising:\n• Postulate 1: The principle of relativity: the laws of physics are the same in all\ninertial frames\n• Postulate 2: The speed of light in vacuum is the same in all inertial frames\nOn the face of it, the second postulate looks nonsensical. How can the speed of light\nlook the same in all inertial frames? If light travels towards me at speed c and I run\naway from the light at speed v, surel", " c and I run\naway from the light at speed v, surely I measure the speed of light as c −v. Right?\nWell, no.\n– 107 –\n", "This common sense view is encapsulated in the Galilean transformations that we\nmet in Section 1.2.1. Mathematically, we derive this “obvious” result as follows: two\ninertial frames, S and S0, which move relative to each with velocity v = (v, 0, 0), have\nCartesian coordinates related by\nx0 = x −vt\n,\ny0 = y\n,\nz0 = z\n,\nt0 = t\n(7.1)\nIf a ray of light travels in the x direction in frame S with speed c,", "ravels in the x direction in frame S with speed c, then it traces out\nthe trajectory x/t = c. The transformations above then tell us that in frame S0 the\ntrajectory of the light ray is x0/t0 = c −v. This is the result we claimed above: the\nspeed of light should clearly be c −v. If this is wrong (and it is) something must be\nwrong with the Galilean transformations (7.1). But what?\nOur immediate goa", "transformations (7.1). But what?\nOur immediate goal is to ﬁnd a transformation law that obeys both postulates above.\nAs we will see, the only way to achieve this goal is to allow for a radical departure in\nour understanding of time.

We will see that time ticks at\ndi↵erent rates for ", "We will see that time ticks at\ndi↵erent rates for observers sitting in di↵erent inertial frames.\n7.1 Lorentz Transformations\nWe stick with the idea of two inertial frames, S and S0, moving with relative speed v.\nFor simplicity, we’ll start by ignoring the directions y and z which are perpendicular to\nthe direction of motion. Both inertial frames come with Cartesian coordinates: (x, t)\nfor S and (x", "me with Cartesian coordinates: (x, t)\nfor S and (x0, t0) for S0. We want to know how these are related. The most general\npossible relationship takes the form\nx0 = f(x, t)\n,\nt0 = g(x, t)\nfor some function f and g. However, there are a couple of facts that we can use to\nimmediately restrict the form of these functions. The ﬁrst is that the law of inertia\nholds; left alone in an inertial frame, a par", "rtia\nholds; left alone in an inertial frame, a particle will travel at constant velocity. Drawn\nin the (x, t) plane, the trajectory of such a particle is a straight line. Since both S and\nS0 are inertial frames, the map (x, t) 7! (x0, t0) must map straight lines to straight lines;\nsuch maps are, by deﬁnition, linear. The functions f and g must therefore be of the\nform\nx0 = ↵1x + ↵2t\n,\nt0 = ↵3x + ↵", "efore be of the\nform\nx0 = ↵1x + ↵2t\n,\nt0 = ↵3x + ↵4t\nwhere ↵i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 can each be a function of v.\n– 108 –\n", "Secondly, we use the fact that S0 is travelling at speed v relative\nt\nx\nS’\nFigure 43:\nto S. This means that an observer sitting at the origin, x0 = 0,\nof S0 moves along the trajectory x = vt in S shown in the ﬁgure.\nOr, in other words, the points x = vt must map to x0 = 0.

Together with\nthe requirement that the transformation is linear, this restricts\nthe coeﬃcients ↵1 and ↵2 above to be of the form,\nx0 = γ(x −vt)\n(7.2)\nfor some coeﬃcient γ. Once again, the overall coeﬃcient γ can be a function of the\nvelocity: γ = γv. (We’ve used subscript notation γv rather than the more standard γ(v)\nto denote that γ depends on v", "e more standard γ(v)\nto denote that γ depends on v. This avoids confusion with the factors of (x−vt) which\naren’t arguments of γ but will frequently appear after γ like in the equation (7.2)).\nThere is actually a small, but important, restriction on the form of γv: it must be\nan even function, so that γv = γ−v. There are a couple of ways to see this. The ﬁrst\nis by using rotational invariance, whi", "s. The ﬁrst\nis by using rotational invariance, which states that γ cannot depend on the direction\nof the relative velocity v, but only on the magnitude v2 = v · v. Alternatively, if this\nis a little slick, we can reach the same conclusion by considering inertial frames ˜S and\n˜S0 which are identical to S and S0 except that we measure the x-coordinate in the\nopposite direction, meaning ˜x = −x and ", "te in the\nopposite direction, meaning ˜x = −x and ˜x0 = −x0. While S is moving with velocity\n+v relative to S0, ˜S is moving with velocity −v with respect to ˜S0 simply because we\nmeasure things in the opposite direction. That means that\n˜x0 = γ−v\n!\n˜x + v˜t\n\"\nComparing this to (7.2), we see that we must have γv = γ−v as claimed.\nWe can also look at things from the perspective of S0, relative to\nt", "t things from the perspective of S0, relative to\nt’\nx’\nS\nFigure 44:\nwhich the frame S moves backwards with velocity −v. The same\nargument that led us to (7.2) now tells us that\nx = γ(x0 + vt0)\n(7.3)\nNow the function γ = γ−v. But by the argument above, we know\nthat γv = γ−v. In other words, the coeﬃcient γ appearing in (7.3)\nis the same as that appearing in (7.2).\n– 109 –\n", "aring in (7.2).\n– 109 –\n", "At this point, things don’t look too di↵erent from what we’ve seen before. Indeed, if\nwe now insisted on absolute time, so t = t0, we’re forced to have γ = 1 and we get back\nto the Galilean transformations (7.1). However, as we’ve seen, this is not compatible\nwith the second postulate of special relativity. So let’s push forward and insist instead\nthat the speed of light is equal to c in both S an", "that the speed of light is equal to c in both S and S0. In S, a light ray has trajectory\nx = ct\nWhile, in S0, we demand that the same light ray has trajectory\nx0 = ct0\nSubstituting these trajectories into (7.2) and (7.3), we have two equations relating t\nand t0,\nct0 = γ(c −v)t\nand\nct = γ(c + v)t0\nA little algebra shows that these two equations are compatible only if γ is given by\nγ =\ns\n1\n1 −v2/c2\n", "compatible only if γ is given by\nγ =\ns\n1\n1 −v2/c2\n(7.4)\nWe’ll be seeing a lot of this coeﬃcient γ in what follows. Notice that for v ⌧c, we\nhave γ ⇡1 and the transformation law (7.2) is approximately the same as the Galilean\ntransformation (7.1). However, as v ! c we have γ ! 1. Furthermore, γ becomes\nimaginary for v > c which means that we’re unable to make sense of inertial frames\nwith relative ", "le to make sense of inertial frames\nwith relative speed v > c.\nEquations (7.2) and (7.4) give us the transformation law for the spatial coordinate.\nBut what about for time?

But this is not the\nsame thing as what the observer actually sees, for this also involves the time that the\nlight took to travel from the event to the observer.

What do Lorentz contracted objects really look like?\nAs we will now s", "tracted objects really look like?\nAs we will now show, writing the Lorentz group as SL(2, C) gives a wonderfully elegant\nway to answer this question. Moreover, what we will ﬁnd is somewhat surprising.\nWhat an observer actually sees are, of course, light rays. As objects move through\nMinkowski space, they emit light which then propagates to the position of the observer.\nWe’ve drawn this in the diag", "tion of the observer.\nWe’ve drawn this in the diagrams, both of which have the observer placed at the origin\nof Minkowski space.
